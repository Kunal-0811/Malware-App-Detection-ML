This project focuses on detecting Android malware using machine learning techniques. It employs Naïve Bayes, decision trees, and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Adaboost) to analyze app features and classify them as either benign or malicious. The goal is to enhance cybersecurity by identifying potentially harmful applications on Android devices.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries and Frameworks: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

Tools: Jupyter Notebook (for development and analysis)

Key Features

Data Collection: Gathered a dataset of Android app features, distinguishing between benign and malicious apps.

Data Preprocessing: Handled imbalanced datasets, applied feature scaling, and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Model Implementation: Implemented machine learning models including Naïve Bayes, decision trees, Random Forest, and Adaboost for classification.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess effectiveness in malware detection.

Deployment Potential: Designed for potential integration into Android security systems or as a standalone detection tool.
